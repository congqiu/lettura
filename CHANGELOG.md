# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Personal Access Tokens (PAT) management UI and API (`POST/GET /api/v1/tokens`, `DELETE /api/v1/tokens/:id`). Tokens authenticate alongside JWT via `Authorization: Bearer lta_...`. Fine-grained scope: `read` (GET-only) or `write` (full API).
- `lettura-cli` AI-first CLI with subcommands: `login`, `whoami`, `config`, `list`, `search`, `get` (markdown/json/html/text), `save` (with `--wait`), `tag` / `untag` / `archive` / `star` (single + batch via `--filter`), `tags`, `skill print` / `skill install`.
- Filter DSL for `list` / batch operations: AND-combined conditions like `tag:rust,untagged,since:7d`.
- Bulk endpoints `POST /api/v1/entries/bulk/{tag,untag,archive,star}` with required `dry_run` preview step.
- Skill source `skills/lettura.md`, served publicly at `GET /skills/lettura.md` with server-version + base-URL substitution, and bundled into the CLI binary via rust-embed (`lettura-cli skill install`).
- GitHub Actions release workflow building `lettura-cli` for linux-x86_64, darwin-x86_64, and darwin-aarch64; `scripts/install-cli.sh` downloads the matching tarball.

### Changed
- Entry save (`POST /api/v1/entries`) is now idempotent: same URL returns existing entry with `already_existed: true`, tag set merged as union.
- `GET /api/v1/entries` list endpoint gained filters: `tag`, `exclude_tag`, `untagged`, `domain`, `since`, `before`, `is_read` (alias for `is_archived`).
- Repo is now a Cargo workspace (`.` and `cli/`); server crate is still `lettura`.
- Search index switched to buffered writes with a 3-second background flush and graceful-shutdown flush, eliminating per-write fsync. Permanent-delete and admin reindex still commit synchronously.
- `process_images` downloads images in parallel (max 8 in flight) and applies URL replacements longest-first to avoid substring collisions.

### Fixed
- `admin reindex` now commits the index clear before the rebuild, preventing a half-cleared index if the rebuild phase fails.
- PAT `last_used_at` update no longer aborts the request on transient DB errors.

### Security
- PAT tokens stored as SHA-256 hash only; only the first 12 bytes (`lta_…`) kept in plaintext for UI display.
- PAT and feed tokens now use `OsRng` with rejection sampling for uniform character distribution (replaces biased modulo over `thread_rng`).
- Path-traversal hardening on `/storage/*` and `/p/<slug>/<file>`: reject parent/root/empty path segments and percent-encoded escapes.
- Prometheus metric labels normalize `/p/<slug>` → `/p/{slug}` and `/feed/<token>` → `/feed/{token}` to prevent unbounded label cardinality and feed-token leakage.
